**OBSERVATIONS**  

**1.** The highlights show that **347 cars** were sold in total in 2022. That corresponds to **10 different car brands** and **15 different models** sold across 2 countries. The **overall revenue** generated by all 10 car dealers in 2 countries was **$9 071 000**. The **profit** reached **$1 119 000**.  

**2.** Although by area, Botswana is about two times smaller than South Africa, in 2022, its car dealers generated 67.42% ($6 116 000) of the overall revenue for both countries. The South Africa's dealers contributed only 32.58% ($2 955 000) of the overall revenue. These numbers roughly coinside with the number of car dealers in each country: 7 in Botswana and 3 in South Africa.  

**3.** The bar chart representing top-3 most popular models, in fact, displays 4 model names, which do not show significant difference in number of sales. The most popular car model among cutomers in 2022 was 3 Series(BMW) with 33 sales in total. It was closely followed by Qashqai(Nissan) with 32 sales. The third place by popularity was, however, shared by Polo(Volkswagen) and Rio(Kia) sold 29 times each.  

**4.** In terms of revenue generated by each of the 10 car brands, the figures are spread across a wide spectrum, ranging from $228 000 by Renault to $1 785 000 by BMW. The profit line, in general, follows the revenue trend with two exceptions: Toyota and Ford. Those two brands returned significantly higher profits in respect to their revenue figures.

**5.** The interactive map shows uneaven geographical distribution of the car dealer shops, which suggests logistical consequences. Only two of the sales points are located on the coast (South Africa: Durban, Cape Town), while the rest is situated inland. Botswana's shops are clustered around big cities and have shorter distances between each other, in comparison to the shops in South Africa.

**6.** Unsurprisingly, the biggest revenue in each country was generated in capital cities: $2 006 000 (77 cars) in Gaborone (Botswana) and $1 263 000 (46 cars) in Cape Town (South Africa).
